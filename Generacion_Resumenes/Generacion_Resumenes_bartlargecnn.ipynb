It refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, largely driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing global temperatures to rise. The consequences of climate change include more frequent extreme weather events like hurricanes, heatwaves, and floods, as well as rising sea levels and changes in ecosystems. Addressing climate change requires international cooperation, shifting to renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and adopting sustainable practices in agriculture, transportation, and industry. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in mitigating the effects of climate change and protecting the planet for future generations.\n",
